# consolefire

## About

A simple cli program that displays a fire-like animation

The "fire algorithm" is heavily inspired from the following article:
http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/

This current version has some colors,
but I am planning on improving this little thing during my free time.

## Compilation

Use the following command to build this project:
```bash
$ make
```

To delete everything generated by make, use the following command:
```bash
$ make clean
```


## Usage

To launch the program, use the following command:
```bash
$ ./consolefire
```

Once the program is launch, the fire starts automatically.
To estinguish the fire and exit the program, press 'a'.
